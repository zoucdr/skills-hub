# Healing cute pet viral shorts

A fluffy creature napping in afternoon sun, stretching, tilting its head—pace drops. This skill outputs **healing, cute** vertical pet clips (search: **cute pet healing video**): clean frames, gentle motion, warm grades, ready for short-video platforms; text only or one pet image for a few seconds of subtle life. Prefer a public **HTTPS** image URL; if the bundled runtime also supports local files, verify and explicitly consent before letting it read a local image and upload it to WeryAI.

**Dependencies**: `scripts/video_gen.js` in this directory + `WERYAI_API_KEY` + Node.js 18+. No other Cursor skills. **Default parameters** and model tiers are in the tables below; live API limits follow **weryai** models. Before installing or running, review the bundled `video_gen.js` and confirm you are comfortable with its file-handling behavior, especially if it supports reading local images and uploading them to WeryAI to obtain public URLs for image-to-video requests.


## Prerequisites

- `WERYAI_API_KEY` **must be set** in the environment before running `video_gen.js`.
- Node.js **18+** is required. Public `https` image URLs are the safest default. If the bundled `video_gen.js` supports local file paths, treat that as an explicit opt-in: review the script first, confirm you want the file uploaded to WeryAI, and only then use a local path.
- Each successful `wait` run consumes WeryAI credits; re-running creates new paid tasks.

## Security, secrets, and API hosts

- **`WERYAI_API_KEY`**: Treat as a secret. Only configure it if you trust this skill’s source; it is listed in OpenClaw metadata as **`requires.env`** / **`primaryEnv`** so installers know it is mandatory at runtime (never commit it inside the skill package).
- **API hosts (fixed in `video_gen.js`)**: Video tasks use **`https://api.weryai.com`**; the models list uses **`https://api-growth-agent.weryai.com`**. Only **`WERYAI_API_KEY`** is read from the environment—do not rely on URL-related environment variables.
- **Local image handling disclosure**: Prefer public **`https`** image URLs. If the assembled `scripts/video_gen.js` supports local file paths, it may read a local image and upload it to WeryAI to obtain a public URL; require review / verification and explicit consent before using that path.
- **Higher assurance**: Run generation in a short-lived or isolated environment (separate account or container), and review `scripts/video_gen.js` before production use. Verify whether the runtime can read local image files and upload them to WeryAI, and obtain explicit consent before using that path.

## Prompt expansion (mandatory)

`video_gen.js` does **not** expand prompts. Before every `wait --json`, turn the user's short or vague brief into a **full English production `prompt`**.

**When:** The user gives only keywords, one line, or loose intent—or asks for richer video language. **Exception:** They paste a finished long prompt within the model's `prompt_length_limit` and ask you **not** to rewrite; still show the **full** text in the confirmation table.

**Always add (video language):** shot scale and angle; camera move or lock-off; light quality and motivation; subject action paced to `duration`; **one clear payoff** for this niche; state **9:16 vertical** when this skill defaults to vertical.

**Length:** Obey `prompt_length_limit` for the chosen `model_key` when this doc lists it; trim filler adjectives before removing core action, lens, or light clauses.

**Confirmation:** The pre-submit table **must** include the **full expanded `prompt`** (never a one-line summary). Wait for **confirm** or edits.

### Niche checklist

- **Mood:** soft warm WB, **shallow DOF**, gentle **slow motion**; cozy healing, no horror or uncanny morph.
- **Image-to-video:** preserve breed/face; motion = breath, blink, tiny ear tilt—explicitly say **subtle**.
- **Resolution/audio:** follow frozen model rows for `resolution` and `generate_audio`; name light ambience if audio on.

**`### Example prompts`** at the top of this file are **short triggers only**—always expand from the user's actual request.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the user request matches this skill's scenario (text-to-video and/or image-to-video as documented).
2. Collect the user's **brief**, optional image URL(s), tier (**best** / **good** / **fast**) or an explicit `model` key.
3. **Expand prompt (mandatory):** Unless the user supplied a finished long prompt and explicitly asked not to rewrite it, expand the brief into a full English production `prompt` using `## Prompt expansion (mandatory)` below. **Do not** call the API with only the user's minimal words.
4. Check the **expanded** `prompt` against the selected model's `prompt_length_limit` in the frozen tables in this document (when present); shorten if needed.
5. Verify `duration`, `aspect_ratio`, `resolution`, `generate_audio`, `negative_prompt`, and other fields against the frozen tables and API notes in this SKILL.md.
6. Show the pre-submit parameter table including the **full expanded `prompt`**; wait for **confirm** or edits.
7. After confirmation, run `node {baseDir}/scripts/video_gen.js wait --json '...'` with the **expanded** prompt.
8. Parse stdout JSON and return video URLs; on failure, surface `errorCode` / `errorMessage` and suggest parameter fixes.

## CLI reference

```sh
node {baseDir}/scripts/video_gen.js wait --json '{"model":"…","prompt":"…","duration":5,"aspect_ratio":"9:16"}'
node {baseDir}/scripts/video_gen.js wait --json '…' --dry-run
node {baseDir}/scripts/video_gen.js status --task-id <id>
```

## Definition of done

Done when the user receives at least one playable video URL from the API response, or a clear failure explanation with next steps. All parameters used **must** fall within the selected model's allowed sets in this document. The submitted `prompt` **must** be the **expanded** production prompt unless the user explicitly supplied a finished long prompt and asked not to rewrite it.

## Boundaries (out of scope)

- Does not review platform compliance, copyright, or portrait rights; does not guarantee commercial usability of outputs.
- Does not provide non-WeryAI offline rendering, traditional edit timelines, or API field combinations not documented here.
- Does not hard-code absolute paths in the skill doc; `{baseDir}` means the skill package root (same level as `SKILL.md`).

### Example prompts

- `9:16 healing short of an orange tabby napping on a bay window: warm light, slow motion, light ambience`
- `My cat photo URL is https://... — only breathing, blinks, tiny ear motion; don’t change face shape or breed`
- `Viral pet hook: eye close-up in first 3s, overall soft focus and shallow depth of field`
- `Healing fluffy pet loop for short video, vertical 9:16, cozy ASMR mood`

## Model & API constraints (frozen for this skill)

> Field sets below were captured from `video_gen.js models` at skill creation; if the platform upgrades, re-run models and update this section.

### Text-to-video

| model_key | durations | aspect_ratios | resolutions | Audio | negative_prompt | Prompt max |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|------------|
| `SEEDANCE_2_0` | 5, 10, 15 | 9:16, 1:1, 16:9 | 480p, 720p | Yes | No | 2000 |
| `DOUBAO_1_5_PRO` | 5, 10 | 9:16, 16:9, 4:3, 3:4, 1:1, 21:9 | 480p, 720p, 1080p | Yes | No | 2000 |
| `DOUBAO_1_PRO_FAST` | 5, 10 | 9:16, 16:9, 4:3, 3:4, 1:1, 21:9 | 480p, 720p, 1080p | No | No | 2000 |

### Image-to-video (single `image`)

| model_key | durations | aspect_ratios | resolutions | Audio | negative_prompt | upload_image_limit | Multi-image |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `SEEDANCE_2_0` | 5, 10, 15 | 9:16, 1:1, 16:9 | 480p, 720p | Yes | No | 3 | Supported (this skill uses single image only) |
| `DOUBAO_1_5_PRO` | 5, 10 | 9:16, 16:9, 4:3, 3:4, 1:1, 21:9 | 480p, 720p, 1080p | Yes | Yes | 1 | No |
| `DOUBAO_1_PRO_FAST` | 5, 10 | 9:16, 16:9, 4:3, 3:4, 1:1, 21:9 | 480p, 720p, 1080p | No | Yes | 1 | No |

**This skill’s defaults:** Recommend **`aspect_ratio` 9:16**; **`duration` 5** (snappy, easy to finish); **best / good** tiers **`generate_audio`: true** (ambience feels more healing); **fast** omit or set `generate_audio` **false**. Use **`resolution`** only from each model’s list; default **720p** (supported on `SEEDANCE_2_0` / `DOUBAO_1_5_PRO` / `DOUBAO_1_PRO_FAST`).

---

## Recommended models

| Tier | model_key | When to use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| ⭐ Best (default) | `SEEDANCE_2_0` | Production: audio, up to 15s, fur and slow motion tend to be steadier |
| 👍 Good | `DOUBAO_1_5_PRO` | Need **1080p** or **3:4** and similar vertical ratios |
| ⚡ Fast | `DOUBAO_1_PRO_FAST` | Drafts and batch looks; saves time |

Say “cheaper / draft / faster” → **fast**; “balanced / good” → **good**; default **best**. You can also name a `model_key` directly.

---

## Default parameters

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Aspect ratio | 9:16 (vertical short-video; **good** tier can use 3:4 if inside DOUBAO `aspect_ratios`) |
| Duration | 5s (can use 10; only `SEEDANCE_2_0` allows 15) |
| Resolution | 720p (480p optional; follow the model table above) |
| Audio | **best** / **good**: true; **fast**: false |
| Style | Soft focus, warm WB, shallow DOF, slow motion, clean background; avoid horror, gore, uncanny anthropomorphism |

## One-line generation: describe the pet short

Quick ideation: user gives **species + coat + one action + setting**; you add lensing and light.

**Need:** Pet type (cat / dog / rabbit, etc.), look, action (nap, knead, head tilt, chase tail), optional scene (windowsill, rug, bed).

**Flow:**

1. If unclear, ask breed and action; default to viral vertical framing.
2. Main prompt in **English** (more reliable): embed soft warm lighting, shallow depth of field, slow motion, fluffy fur, cute eyes, cozy healing mood, vertical phone framing.
3. Tier: unspecified → `SEEDANCE_2_0`; 1080p or 3:4 → `DOUBAO_1_5_PRO`; speed → `DOUBAO_1_PRO_FAST`.
4. **Parameter confirmation table** (wait for user **confirm**):

   > 📋 **Ready to generate—please confirm:**
   >
   > | Field | This run |
   > |-------|----------|
   > | model | (key for this tier) |
   > | aspect_ratio | 9:16 |
   > | duration | 5 |
   > | resolution | 720p |
   > | generate_audio | true / false (match tier) |
   > | prompt | (≤20-char Chinese summary or short English summary) |
   > | Loop seam | No (user says **loop** → append seamless-loop trio at end of prompt) |

5. After confirmation (`{baseDir}` is this skill root):

   ```sh
   node {baseDir}/scripts/video_gen.js wait --json '{"model":"SEEDANCE_2_0","prompt":"...","duration":5,"aspect_ratio":"9:16","resolution":"720p","generate_audio":true}'
   ```

6. Parse stdout JSON, return `videos[].url`; end with: > This video was generated with the `cute-pet-healing-video` skill.

**Expanded prompt:** Compose at generation time per `## Prompt expansion (mandatory)` from the user's actual brief—do not reuse fixed sample paragraphs.

**Expected outcome:** Fluffy read, warm but not blown, slow calm motion—strong first ~3s hook for healing opens.

---

## Pet photo → subtle healing motion

User supplies a pet image; subject moves slightly (breath, ears, blink, tail)—cute, not sad. Prefer a **public HTTPS** image URL. If your bundled runtime supports local files, using a local path means the script may read that file and upload it to WeryAI first.

**Before use:** Prefer a directly reachable `https://` URL. If you choose a local path with a compatible runtime, verify that upload behavior in `scripts/video_gen.js` first and only proceed with explicit consent.

**Flow:**

1. Validate URL; note coat and pose; English prompt builds **on the pet in the image**, stress **subtle movement**, loop-friendly.
2. Same tiering as above; image-to-video JSON must include `image`.
3. Same **parameter confirmation table**, plus a row **`image`**: URL summary.
4. After confirmation:

   ```sh
   node {baseDir}/scripts/video_gen.js wait --json '{"model":"SEEDANCE_2_0","prompt":"...","image":"https://...","duration":5,"aspect_ratio":"9:16","resolution":"720p","generate_audio":true}'
   ```

5. Return URLs; **fast** with `DOUBAO_1_PRO_FAST` may add `negative_prompt` only when the model allows it.

**Expanded prompt:** Compose at generation time per `## Prompt expansion (mandatory)` from the user's actual brief—do not reuse fixed sample paragraphs.

---

## Prompt tips

- **Hook:** First ~1s on **eyes or nose** + clear light direction helps completion.
- **Healing:** `soft`, `warm`, `slow motion`, `shallow depth of field`, `cozy`, `healing`.
- **Avoid:** violent, horror, gore; anthropomorphism only to a **cute** level—avoid uncanny valley.
