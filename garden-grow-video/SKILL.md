# Gardening & plant growth video generation

A seed in soil, roots reaching down, cotyledons breaking the surface, stems stretching day by day, buds swelling, a flower opening in sun—ten seconds can hold a whole life cycle; that’s the magic of timelapse. Bunny with strawberries, bear with succulents, cat with balcony tomatoes: growth *is* the plot.

**Dependencies**: `scripts/video_gen.js` in this directory + `WERYAI_API_KEY` + Node.js 18+. No dependency on other Cursor skills.


## Prerequisites

- `WERYAI_API_KEY` **must be set** in the environment before running `video_gen.js`.
- Node.js **18+** is required. Image inputs **must** be public `https` URLs (no local file paths).
- Each successful `wait` run consumes WeryAI credits; re-running creates new paid tasks.

## Prompt expansion (mandatory)

`video_gen.js` does **not** expand prompts. Before every `wait --json`, turn the user's short or vague brief into a **full English production `prompt`**.

**When:** The user gives only keywords, one line, or loose intent—or asks for richer video language. **Exception:** They paste a finished long prompt within the model's `prompt_length_limit` and ask you **not** to rewrite; still show the **full** text in the confirmation table.

**Always add (video language):** shot scale and angle; camera move or lock-off; light quality and motivation; subject action paced to `duration`; **one clear payoff** for this niche; state **9:16 vertical** when this skill defaults to vertical.

**Length:** Obey `prompt_length_limit` for the chosen `model_key` when this doc lists it; trim filler adjectives before removing core action, lens, or light clauses.

**Confirmation:** The pre-submit table **must** include the **full expanded `prompt`** (never a one-line summary). Wait for **confirm** or edits.

### Niche checklist

- **Time language:** **time-lapse**, visible days/weeks compression, light angle or shadow drift for elapsed time.
- **Beats:** seed/sprout/leaf/flower/fruit as applicable; hands or paws optional; terracotta, soil, glass root views.
- **Payoff:** harvest, full bloom, or filled planter **clearer than start**.

**`### Example prompts`** at the top of this file are **short triggers only**—always expand from the user's actual request.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the user request matches this skill's scenario (text-to-video and/or image-to-video as documented).
2. Collect the user's **brief**, optional image URL(s), tier (**best** / **good** / **fast**) or an explicit `model` key.
3. **Expand prompt (mandatory):** Unless the user supplied a finished long prompt and explicitly asked not to rewrite it, expand the brief into a full English production `prompt` using `## Prompt expansion (mandatory)` below. **Do not** call the API with only the user's minimal words.
4. Check the **expanded** `prompt` against the selected model's `prompt_length_limit` in the frozen tables in this document (when present); shorten if needed.
5. Verify `duration`, `aspect_ratio`, `resolution`, `generate_audio`, `negative_prompt`, and other fields against the frozen tables and API notes in this SKILL.md.
6. Show the pre-submit parameter table including the **full expanded `prompt`**; wait for **confirm** or edits.
7. After confirmation, run `node {baseDir}/scripts/video_gen.js wait --json '...'` with the **expanded** prompt.
8. Parse stdout JSON and return video URLs; on failure, surface `errorCode` / `errorMessage` and suggest parameter fixes.

## CLI reference

```sh
node {baseDir}/scripts/video_gen.js wait --json '{"model":"…","prompt":"…","duration":5,"aspect_ratio":"9:16"}'
node {baseDir}/scripts/video_gen.js wait --json '…' --dry-run
node {baseDir}/scripts/video_gen.js status --task-id <id>
```

## Definition of done

Done when the user receives at least one playable video URL from the API response, or a clear failure explanation with next steps. All parameters used **must** fall within the selected model's allowed sets in this document. The submitted `prompt` **must** be the **expanded** production prompt unless the user explicitly supplied a finished long prompt and asked not to rewrite it.

## Boundaries (out of scope)

- Does not review platform compliance, copyright, or portrait rights; does not guarantee commercial usability of outputs.
- Does not provide non-WeryAI offline rendering, traditional edit timelines, or API field combinations not documented here.
- Does not hard-code absolute paths in the skill doc; `{baseDir}` means the skill package root (same level as `SKILL.md`).

### Example prompts

- `Bunny grows tomatoes on a balcony: seed to red fruit on the vine, vertical timelapse growth`
- `Use this succulent pot image: leaves plump and colors intensify over days`
- `Mushrooms from bag to harvest, healing natural light`
- `Cozy plant growth timelapse 9:16, window sunlight, cute animal gardener`

## Default parameters

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Model | KLING_V3_0_PRO |
| Aspect ratio | 9:16 (fixed) |
| Duration | 10 seconds (`duration`: 10—full growth arc) |
| Audio | Off |
| Visual style | Front medium or top-down; natural light (window sun); timelapse feel; light direction shifts over “days”; simple background (soil, terracotta, wood) |

> **API validity (default `KLING_V3_0_PRO`):** Text-to-video `duration` only **5 / 10 / 15**; `aspect_ratio` only **9:16, 1:1, 16:9**. Image-to-video `aspect_ratio` only **9:16, 16:9, 1:1**. **No `resolution` field—do not send it.** For **fast** tier with VEO: text-to-video **`VEO_3_1_FAST`**, image-to-video **`CHATBOT_VEO_3_1_FAST`**, with `duration` **fixed at 8**, `aspect_ratio` only **9:16** or **16:9**. When switching `model_key`, follow the allowed sets in this section’s model/API constraints and the API validity note above; do not send `resolution` to models that do not support it.

## Seed to sprout to flower and fruit

**Purpose:** Time-compressed growth from planting through a satisfying harvest or bloom. Hero beats: breaking soil and the final flower or fruit moment.

Describe the character and plant—no extra form:

e.g. “bunny grows strawberries” or “cat grows balcony tomatoes”—the skill fills in the full growth arc and visual detail.

Show parameters before generate:

> Generating with the parameters below—reply **confirm** or say what to change:
> - model: KLING_V3_0_PRO
> - aspect_ratio: 9:16
> - duration: 10
> - generate_audio: false
> - Loop seam: No (reply **loop** to enable; appends `seamless loop` to the prompt)

**Expanded prompt:** Compose at generation time per `## Prompt expansion (mandatory)` from the user's actual brief—do not reuse fixed sample paragraphs.

**Parameter configuration:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| model | KLING_V3_0_PRO |
| aspect_ratio | 9:16 |
| duration | 10 |
| generate_audio | false |

**Expected outcome:** Clear time advance; sprouting and bloom/fruit as peaks; light cycles or angle shifts sell the passage of time; ending feels like a payoff.

## Microscopic growth close-ups

Single-plant life at extreme detail: roots in a clear vessel, bud-to-full-bloom timelapse, mushroom from spore stage to pickable—no long story, one magnified process.

Name the plant and stage; then generate:

## Prompt tips

**Timelapse feel:** `time-lapse compression`, `days visible in seconds`, `light cycles through the sequence`, `daily shadows rotate revealing passage of time`

**Life beats:** `seedling breaks through soil surface`, `root tip emerges driven by gravity`, `flower petals open in slow motion`, `fruit swells and deepens in color`

**Texture:** `terracotta pot texture`, `soil granularity visible`, `glass-sided container reveals root system`, `morning window light on dew-covered leaves`

> **Note:** Say **`time-lapse`** explicitly or the model may output a static plant instead of growth. Adding **`light cycling`** or **`shadow angle changing`** strengthens the sense of elapsed time.
